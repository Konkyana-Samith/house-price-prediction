# house-price-prediction
End-to-end machine learning project that predicts house prices using structured housing data. The project includes data cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, feature scaling, training multiple regression models, and evaluating performance using RMSE and R² score.

## Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

## Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

## Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature encoding and scaling
- Model training and evaluation using RMSE and R²

## Result
Random Forest achieved the best performance among all models.

## How to Run
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/train.py
